title: "Signal stickers"
---

If like me you like secure and private messaging, you may be a [Signal](https://signal.org/){:target="_blank"} user. When I first installed Signal, one of the features I missed the most coming from Telegram or WhatsApp was, you guessed it, stickers !

So I began searching where those damn stickers were at. Do I need to create them ? Can I import them ?

Fear not ! There's a nice website where you can install them from : [signalstickers.com](https://signalstickers.com){:target="_blank"}. You can even make [advanced searches](https://signalstickers.com/about){:target="_blank"}

Bonus point: it's community driven. So if you create stickers of find some that are not referenced, __please__, [add them](https://signalstickers.com/contribute){:target="_blank"}.

What are your favorites ? Mine's [Rick and Morty pack](https://signalstickers.com/pack/d9972b04ad521cf093a92b4a5287a93e){:target="_blank"} !
